# We-Care-Hospital-Administration
A Hospital Database Management System (DBMS) focused on the administrative side to facilitate the efficient and accurate management of patient data, billing, prescriptions, room allocations, and other critical functions in healthcare management.

# Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to develop a hospital management system that will 
facilitate effective management of various aspects of the hospital's operations. Using 
Tkinter, the system will provide a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) and 
integrate with a MySQL database to store and retrieve relevant information.  
The system should address the following requirements: 

User Authentication: Implement a secure login mechanism to authenticate users, 
including doctors, nurses, administrative staff, and other personnel. Different levels of 
access should be granted based on user roles to ensure appropriate data privacy and 
security. 

Patient Management: Enable users to manage patient records, including registration, 
appointment scheduling, medical history, and treatment details. The system should 
support functionalities such as adding new patients, updating their information, and 
retrieving patient data when required.

Room Management: Facilitate the allocation and management of hospital rooms. 
Users should be able to assign patients to specific rooms, track room availability, and 
manage patient transfers between rooms.  

Staff Management: Assist in managing hospital personnel, including doctors, nurses, 
and support staff. The system should enable users to track employee information, such 
as work schedules, shifts, department management, and role assignation.  

Billing and Payment: Provide functionality for generating and managing patient bills, 
tracking payments, and generating bill reports. The system should be capable of 
integrating with billing with room rate, latest treatment fees and medicines fees.  

Database Connectivity: Establish a connection to a MySQL database to store and 
retrieve critical information, including patient records, inventory data, staff details, 
billing information, and other relevant data necessary for efficient hospital 
management.  

By addressing these needs, the hospital management system will streamline 
administrative tasks, improve patient care, and enhance overall operational efficiency 
within the hospital environment.
